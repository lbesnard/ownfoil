Ownfoil is a simple webserver aimed at running your own Tinfoil/Awoo shop from your local library, with full shop customisation and authentication. It is designed to periodically scan your library (default every 5 minutes), generate Tinfoil index file and serve it all over HTTP/S. This makes it easy to manage your library and have your personal collection available at any time.

Why this project ? I wanted a lightweight, dead simple, no dependancy and private personal Shop, without having to rely on other proprietary services (Google, 1fichier...) and having to maintain their implementation.

# Usage
Ownfoil is shipped as a Docker container for simplicity and compatibility. You first need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Come back when you have a working installation!

Then, there are two ways to start the container, with `docker run` or `docker-compose`.

## Docker run

Running this command will start the shop on port `8000` with the library in `/your/game/directory` :

    docker run -d -p 8000:80 -v /your/game/directory:/games --name ownfoil a1ex4/ownfoil

The shop is now accessible with your computer/server IP and port, i.e. `http://localhost:8000` from the same computer or `http://192.168.1.100:8000` from a device in your network.

## Docker compose
Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:
```
version: "3"

services:
  ownfoil:
    container_name: ownfoil
    image: a1ex4/ownfoil
    volumes:
      - /your/game/directory:/games
      # Uncomment if you want to edit and persist the app configuration
      # - ./app:/app
      # Uncomment to setup basic auth
      # - ./nginx:/etc/nginx
    # uncomment to have the full host url added to each game/dir
    #environment:
    #  - HOST_URL=http://HOST_IP:8000

    ports:
      - "8000:80"
```

You can then create and start the container with the command (executed in the same directory as the docker-compose file):

    docker-compose up -d

This is usefull if you don't want to remember the `docker run` command and have a persistent and reproductible container configuration.

# Shop Customization
All [Tinfoil shop index keys](https://blawar.github.io/tinfoil/custom_index/) are configurable : simply download the [shop_template.jsonc](./shop_template.jsonc) (__*with the same name*__) to your library directory and fill in the keys. Be careful with the formatting of the file, especially of commas separating the keys.

# Setup Authentication
First, uncomment the "nginx" volume mount in the `docker-compose.yml` file and re-create the container (`docker-compose up -d`). You should now have a `nginx` folder next to the compose file: this folder is mounted inside the container (in `/etc/nginx`) so any changes to this folder will be reflected in the container.

Edit the `nginx/http.d/default.conf` file and uncomment the two lines starting with "auth_basic", so that the file looks like that:
```
...
    location / {
        autoindex on;
        root /games;
        # Uncomment to enable Basic Authentication
        auth_basic "Restricted Content";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    }
...
```
 Then, execute the following commands to generate credential for the user *alex*, the second will prompt you for a password:

    docker exec -it ownfoil sh -c "echo -n 'alex:' >> /etc/nginx/.htpasswd"
    docker exec -it ownfoil sh -c "openssl passwd -apr1 >> /etc/nginx/.htpasswd"
    docker exec -it ownfoil sh -c "nginx -s reload"

You can execute these commands as many times as you want to create users. With the volume mounted these files will be persisted on your host machine and used accross container restart/recreation.
